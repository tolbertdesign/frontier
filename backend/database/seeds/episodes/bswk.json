  "description": "Brecht built a 6-figure online software as a service and training business and he aint even got college. Now he's traveling the country as a digital nomad, full time, with his family of 5. \r\n\r\nScott's got more ivy league degrees than you can shake a stick at but he walked away from high paying corporate job to work from home and run a highly successful web development agency. \r\n\r\nEach week they talk about making a living on the internet, email marketing, conversion rate optimization, website traffic, landing page optimization, how to start an internet business, the and more. Its not a show about \"passive income\" its a show about financial independence and freedom and how we're achieving it while still managing the responsibilities of being a father.",
