              We at Booster value the trust our fun run participants place in our
              company. We take reasonable steps to safeguard that trust by
              implementing measures aimed at keeping nonpublic personal information
              about fun run participants in a secure environment, and by using
              that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We gather
              only the information that we need to administer our business, our
              security and the security of our fun run participants in order to
              provide superior products and service. We do not typically share
              such information with third parties except as necessary to provide
              services to our visitors and for the other specific purposes described
              below.
            </p>
            <h4>Visiting Our Website</h4>
            <p>
              You can visit the Booster website ("Website") without identifying
              yourself or revealing any personal information. We collect and
              monitor user traffic patterns throughout the Website according to
              non-personally identifiable information such as a user's domain
              name, IP address, browser type, date and time of access and pages
              viewed. This non-personally identifiable information is collected
              in order to measure the number of visitors to our Website and to
              determine which areas of the Website receive the most traffic.
            </p>
            <h4>Children Online Privacy Protection</h4>
            <p>
              Our website is intended to be used by Parents/Guardians of fun run
              participants and sponsors over the age of 13.
              By completing the registration process, you are agreeing
              that you are over the age of 13. We never ask for a child's contact information.
              Any personal information of students (name, gender, picture, or personal message)
              can only be entered by a registered Parent/Guardian.
            </p>
            <h4>Information We Collect and How We Use It</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>How We Collect Information. </strong>
              Most information comes
              directly from the Parents/Guardians of fun run participants when they
              access and use our Internet services ("Services").
              When we use the term "Business Information" in this privacy policy,
              we mean information that tells us specifically who a visitor is
              and their contact information, including their
              name, email address, street address and telephone number. We collect
              Business Information when a guardian/representative of a fun run
              participant uses our Services or provides information at our events.
              Visitors to our Website may also provide Business Information and
              other data by pledging money towards a fun run participant. A guardian/representative
              can access their contacts via the Google permissions API if desired. We
              have taken steps to protect the Business Information of our online
              users by utilizing 256-bit SSL encryption to help ensure information
              is secured from unauthorized users, and we protect URI data through
              encrypted variables so that end users cannot read data in the address
              bar of their browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>How We Use Information.</strong>
              We do not rent, lease or sell
              Business Information or Google or Gmail information or contacts to any marketeer.
              All data and contacts transmitted by the Google API and usage information is never
              provided to other visitors or third party websites. If you have any questions
              concerning Google, please visit the link below for further information:

            </p>
            <p>
              We may share Business Information or other data collected from visitors
              with our business associates, including unaffiliated third parties
              who assist us in administering the Services. We may use, share or transfer
              Business Information or other data collected from visitors:

            <ul>
              <li>to provide enhanced services;</li>
              <li>to resolve disputes;</li>
              <li>
                to solicit feedback from fun run participants,
                including potential participation in focus groups to assist in
                improving services;
              </li>
              <li>to maintain and service our systems;</li>
              <li>
                to protect the confidentiality or security of fun run participant's records;
              </li>
              <li>
                to law enforcement or other government officials to protect Booster
                or any fun run participants, or in connection with an investigation
                or prosecution of possible unlawful activity;
              </li>
              <li>in connection with a sale or merger of Booster;</li>
              <li>to recipients of any fund pledges;</li>
              <li>to our attorneys, accountants and regulators;</li>
              <li>or for other legally permissible purposes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If fun run participants or their parent/legal guardian (if child
              is less than 13 years old) opt to allow us to use or share Business
              Information and other data with trusted affiliates, independent
              contractors and other businesses for marketing and business purposes,
              we may choose to do so. Fun run participants are provided with an
              "access code" to input and view personal information. Should a fun
              run participant choose to give this access code to any third party,
              for whatever reason, Booster is not responsible for any information
              obtained by such third party; provided, however, that fun run
              participant information cannot be viewed or edited by the user once
              it has been submitted even if an access code is entered by an
              unauthorized user.
            </p>

              apply to those parties' use or disclosure of such information
              regardless of their affiliation or relationship with us. Because
              we do not control the privacy practices of third parties, visitors
              are subject to the privacy policies and practices of those third
