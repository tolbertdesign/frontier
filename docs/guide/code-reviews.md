### Steps for Code Reviews

1. Try and get a general overview of what the story requirements were, and what the goals of the code changes are.
2. Focus on higher level decisions and changes within the code first, then work toward more granular decisions
3. Work through any code/architectural changes together, if there’s time or if there’s any confusion on how to implement the changes
