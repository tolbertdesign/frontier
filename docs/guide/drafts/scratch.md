### Buefy light-weight UI components

Currently using [Collapse](https://buefy.org/documentation/collapse), [Modal](https://buefy.org/documentation/modal), [Tabs](https://buefy.org/documentation/tabs) and [Toast](https://buefy.org/documentation/toast)

## Component Inventory

### Base

- Avatar
- Button
- Input
- Modal
- Select
- Toggle

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript

- The developer can use whatever they like, locally
- But, the [pre-commit hook] formats for the repository
- 2 spaces, ES5 trailing commas, **no semicolons**... Yeah, I know!
- Try it for [5 minutes](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes) though. :smile:

### PHP

## Testing

### Testing Laravel with PHPUnit

### Best practices for frontend unit testing

### End-to-end testing with Cypress

## Welcome to the Engineering team's knowledge base

> A [knowledge base](https://www.atlassian.com/itsm/knowledge-management/what-is-a-knowledge-base) is a self-serve online library of information about a product, service, department, or topic. The data in your knowledge base can come from anywhere. Typically, contributors who are well versed in the relevant subjects add to and expand the knowledge base.

### The Difference Between a Knowledge Base and a Wiki

On the surface, you may think that a knowledge base and a wiki are the same thing. Both of them provide a central place for storing and sharing information for users to access. But if you dig a little deeper, there are some subtle yet significant differences.

The main disparity is that wikis are primarily a collaborative tool, where everyone can view and contribute to the information within it. This differs from a knowledge base, which is viewed solely as a place for storing and accessing information, which would have been created by dedicated resources.

#### What is a wiki

If you think about the most famous wiki of them all, Wikipedia, the articles within are created, edited, and collaborated by people from all over the world. So if a reader of a wiki article were to disagree with the content, or feel that they could do a better job, they can simply edit the article there and then, for instant results. Indeed, the word “wiki” actually originates from Hawaiian, meaning “very quick”; so we can see why wikis are viewed as immediate sources of information.

However, whilst wikis may be a fantastic instrument for collaboration, this does present some issues in terms of accuracy and quality control. In other words, anyone can write whatever they want! With a vast number of contributors and limited moderation, content could be inaccurate and styling inconsistent. It’s important, especially in a corporate environment, that information available to team members is legitimate, and that it enables the sharing of information to be streamlined and more efficient.

#### What is a knowledge base

This is where a knowledge base really shines; with specifically appointed resources, articles are written with clarity and proficiency. In terms of our dedicated eponymous intranet knowledge base application, users are assigned to categories that best suit their field of expertise, meaning that articles are only written by those who are best-informed. Having these “category experts” ensures that the material that users are accessing is accurate, and that they have a go-to resource for specific categories, and thus improving the sharing of information.
