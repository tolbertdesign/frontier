Dear Christy,

I would like to attend Laracon US 2020, the official Laravel conference, held this year in Atlanta on July 28th & 29th. I feel that the investment will yield a major return as the event aligns directly with the priorities of our team.

The cost of attendance is a very good value for the level of intensive web-application development education that I would receive over the course of the 2 day event. As an attendee of Laracon 2020, I’ll have access to:

- 18 talks from international experts in the Laravel and web-engineering industry
- 2 full days networking and knowledge-sharing with over 700+ fellow engineers
- Hands-on training through workshops with leading experts of their fields

Laracon is an international gathering of the Laravel community to learn, share, discuss, and
advance the Laravel framework and modern web-application development practices, as well as to network with other Laravel and PHP community members.

I will have the opportunity to meet Laravel’s author, community leaders, top developers, my favorite module maintainers, potential business partners, and future co-workers.

I am seeking approval for the **$499 registration fee**.

Should 3 or more members of our team wish to attend the event, we will receive a discount on the conference tickets.

Please accept this proposal to attend as I’m confident of the significant return that we will receive for the small investment.

For more information about the event, please visit the conference website at <http://laracon.us.>

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Victor
