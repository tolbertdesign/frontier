## About `vue-meta`

`vue-meta` is a plugin for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/#What-is-Vue-js) to manage metadata using Vue's built-in reactivity

Just add the special property `metaInfo` to any or all components as these will be automatically merged top-down

Nested components can overwrite each others values which allows easy adding or removing of metadata where and when necessary
