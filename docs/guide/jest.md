[Jest](https://jestjs.io) is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

Jest tests are meant to ensure **Vue.js** code quality in our projects (see [documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started)). CircleCI will run all Jest tests in a codebase on pull requests and are required to pass before merging in code changes.

## Code Coverage
