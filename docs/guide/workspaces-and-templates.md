title: Workspaces, Templates, and YOU!
---
Hey, guys.

Ok, maybe I was stretching a tad on the Subject line. üòä  I wanted to share a few key workflows that I‚Äôve been trying to figure out in the **Architecture &amp; Security project** for us to leverage. Enjoy reading below. I have no doubt you will all have a ton of questions. Let‚Äôs be sure to chat thru them!

Did you know‚Ä¶

## Workspaces

Workspaces are pretty simple. It‚Äôs a means of combining multiple projects into a single view in PT. Here is the link to the one below:

Some things that I find useful about workspaces:

- It can give me insight into multiple projects at one time.
- If projects are setup with the same cycles, it‚Äôs simple to see how they are progressing.
- Stories, bugs and chores can move from one project to another leveraging drag-n-drop. 
- Epics cannot move across project boundaries.
- You can also perform larger bulk functions by selecting the checkbox at the right of every story.

Ex: you want to move 5 stories at one time.

## Templates

Templates are another very simple concept. Templates only apply to the Description field.
Did you know you can create templates? Templates create a simple format for use in a Story‚Äôs Description.

## Architecture & Security Workflow

You‚Äôve now seen workspaces and templates. Here‚Äôs where I got a little crazy. Because PT doesn‚Äôt have the concept of customizable workflows and status, I am brute forcing this by using Releases (blue bars when collapsed) and Reviews.

Important note: The following is new and will be worked out over the coming sprints to help make it more clear!

In the Architecture &amp; Security project, the Icebox is grouped by items (aka releases) where:

### Step #1

STATUS: Architecture Debt Backlog ‚Äì items related to architecture/technical debt or new technical items

STATUS: Security Backlog ‚Äì items related to security

STATUS: DevOps Backlog ‚Äì items related to DevOps

### Step #2

STATUS: Architecture Meeting Topic/Grooming ‚Äì Items are groomed by engineering and presented to Jey when story/concept is ready to move forward. High-level ideas should be broken down accordingly.

### Step #3

STATUS: Ready for Backlog Grooming ‚Äì items are groomed in our traditional Product-led grooming session. All stories should be understood, test scenarios outlined, points assigned.

### Step #4

STATUS: Ready for Sprint Planning ‚Äì Story is awaiting sprint assignment/prioritization by Product and/or Tech Leadership Team

## Step #5

STATUS: Ready for Development  - Story priority is set. Next is moving the story into Project Titan for implementation.

Epics/stories/bugs/chores should essentially flow from a Backlog to Architecture Meeting Topic/Grooming to Backlog Grooming (hosted by Jey) to Ready for Sprint Planning. Items that are in Ready for Sprint Planning are awaiting sprint assignment by the Tech Leadership. We will pull items into Ready for Development when they are the next items to work from the backlog.
All items committed to in a sprint will be moved into the current sprint in the Project Titan project.

### Reviews Types

Some of these types might feel a tad redundant. However, the reviews ensure that we now have a historical context of how our stories have progressed thru our workflow. Put on your auditor hat, and you quickly go, ‚ÄúAhhhhh‚Ä¶‚Äù üòä

Splitting Current Iteration & Backlog
One more fun thing, if you‚Äôve gotten this far. Did you know that you can separate the Current Iteration and Backlog? By default, these are combined.

Look in your left-hand nav and the top of your story listing. Notice how it shows as ‚ÄúCurrent Iteration/Backlog.‚Äù Click the burger/dot menu as shown, select ‚ÄúSplit Current Iteration and Backlog‚Äù.
