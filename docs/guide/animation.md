title: Effective UI Animation
---

Doing effective UI transitions and animation has been an interest for some  time now, but haven’t been able to spend much time digging in. Now, the current version of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) has some built-in motion utilities ([transitions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/transition-duration/) and [transforms](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/scale)).

It should be easier to explore and refine some interactions [IxD]()

I have this book...

I think the FLIP technique is awesome.
