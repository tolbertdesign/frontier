## Dev & Ops

### New Delivery Pipeline

Improve confidence in product/s [code] delivery mechanism.

- Decrease deployment time.
  - Communication improvement for all deployments. Leveraging the #deployment channel.
  - Add stories to release item [in Pivotal] as soon as an item is accepted to allow for improved change control measures.
  - New branching model started -- eliminating feature/epic branches and moving closer to a continuous integration model.
- Introduce automated smoke test suite.
- Hire DevOps Engineer
- Automate Y% of deployment pipeline
  - Stretch: Proof of Concept for automated deployments leveraging CircleCI.

### Improve Development Quality

Become black belts in the software craft.

- Ensure code complexity does not exceed X%
  - Introduced code reviews requiring at least 1 peer code review be performed.
- Maintain rejection rate < 10% per sprint
  - Evaluate and review rejection rate at the end of every sprint.
  - Engineers work more closely with QA to shorten the time span between code complete, code delivered to QA and QA test cycle.
  - Better common understanding of [defect/story] testing scenarios.
- Hire Software Test Engineer
- Stretch: Maintain test code coverage > Y%

### Continuous Improvement

Build a responsive, proactive team in both scale and skilss to support Booster's explosive growth.

- Create career opportunities with defined paths
  - New dev team structure / roles were presented to the Engineering team as part of the January kick-off. Paths and essential duties for each role are still outstanding.
- Every team member has a development plan in place, and we're reviewing it at least monthly.
  - All members are reading Crucial Conversations as part of a group book club.
- Introduce new Agile team roles and strategy to transition
  - Introduced team roles and plan, including hiring, to transition to multiple dev teams.
- Strectch: Transition to new Agile team role and composition

### Security

Establish improved security engineering practices, testing guidelines and operational processes for supporting Boosterthon.

- Understand Booster's current security posture.
  - TK and Titan have been scanned and evaluatee. Posture presentation outlined the largest areas of concern to address -- TK (outdated code base), XSS and SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
  - Approach has been introduced and implementation started for remedying the highest risk XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Provide at least one security-based training to Engineering+QA
  - In-house security expert, Miguel Williams, held a security training session. Additionally, the team completed on-line training offered thru our Portswigger account. (Team has requested we do a security training quarterly going forward.)
- Establish a Security Operations group
  - Security guild created, and monthly sessions have been established.
  - Create a new security escalation workflow, ownership model and communication strategy. Rolloout Q4, hopefully.
  - Created a new Pivotal Tracker project, Security, for story and issue tracking.
- Perform PCI Level 2 audit for new compliance level
  - Identify a vendor to leverage for an on-site, authorized security audit.
  - Ongoing efforts thru Q4 to work with Security Metrics to attain PCI Level 2 approval.
